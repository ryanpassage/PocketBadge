Another try at unlocking doors with Bluetooth and magic.

This is 2016's attempt at using Bluetooth beacons to unlock doors for me (I am convinced this is a good idea).

This app is a lot simpler than Open Sesame, although it uses different methods (such as Notifications instead of KVO, and the actual Estimote Beacon SDK instead of CoreLocation).

It actually worked better than Open Sesame but still wasn't as reliable as I wanted it to be.  Beacon ranging/changes aren't as snappy as they need to be.
